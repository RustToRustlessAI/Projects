# RustToRustlessAI-Projects  

🚀 Welcome to **RustToRustlessAI-Projects**!  

This repository documents my journey back into software development after 10 years, using AI-powered coding tools like **Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and ChatGPT** to accelerate learning and productivity.  

## 📌 What You'll Find Here  
✅ AI-powered projects (chatbots, automation, AI-integrated apps)  
✅ Code experiments with modern frameworks and AI tools  
✅ Lessons learned and progress updates  

## 🎯 Goal  
To transition from "rusty" to "rustless" by building and sharing **AI-assisted development projects**.  

## 📁 Projects  
- **AI Chatbot** – A simple chatbot using OpenAI API  
- **Automation Scripts** – AI-powered automation tools  
- More coming soon!
